Central to SMU’s city campus, SMU Libraries are places of discovery and are active environments that inspire and educate. The Libraries contribute to the research, teaching, and learning needs of the SMU community through two physical libraries, Li Ka Shing Library and Kwa Geok Choo Law Library and via digital services.
